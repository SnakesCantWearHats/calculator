Made by me. Took me a long time, but it was a good learning experience. Made with ReactJS and create-react-app.
Still some bugs are present, like the coma button does nothing and I think there is till some problem with how the calculator behaves in general if you dont do everything perfectly.
Later gonna add something to make it react (hehe) to keyboard input.
